# Python Mini-Apps Collection

Welcome to my collection of small Python projects! This repository is a playground where I apply and demonstrate my understanding of core Python concepts, from fundamentals to more advanced topics.

Each project is self-contained in its own directory.

## Projects

## Setup & Installation

To run these projects, it's recommended to first create a virtual environment.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git
    cd YourRepoName
    ```
2. **(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Now you are ready to navigate into any project directory and run the applications!
